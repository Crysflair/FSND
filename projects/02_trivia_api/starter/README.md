# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis 
and created a web page to manage the trivia app and play the game.

This app is able to:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

The code adheres to the PEP 8 style guide.

## Getting Started
### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask application and a SQLAlchemy server.
The [README.md](./backend/README.md) within `./backend` gives instructions on how to start the Flask application,
how to set up a test database and test if the app runs properly.


### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. 
The [README.md](./frontend/README.md) within `./frontend ` gives instructions on how to start the React application.
