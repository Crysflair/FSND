    Create a POST endpoint to get questions to play the quiz. 
    This endpoint should take category and previous question parameters 
    and return a random questions within the given category, 
    if provided, and that is not one of the previous questions. 
  
    TEST: In the "Play" tab, after a user selects "All" or a category,
    one question at a time is displayed, the user is allowed to answer
    and shown whether they were correct or not.
